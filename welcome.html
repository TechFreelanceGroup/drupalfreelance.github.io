    Thanks for joining the Drupal Freelance Group!

    You should already be added automatically to the Announcements, Drupal Freelance Hub and Member Introductions groups.
    Most new members start with introducing themselves in the Member Introductions group. We would like to know a little bit about you!
    General discussions happen in the Drupal Freelance Hub channel.
    If you would like to see available freelance Drupal jobs, then joining the Jobs channel would be a good idea.
    If you have a blog, send me the RSS feed and your posts will automatically be pubished in the Members' Blog channel.
    The Drupal Freelance group is a inclusive community. We welcome all people from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. 

    Feel free also to review the mission of this group and invite your Drupal developer contacts to this group. The more people join, the more useful this community will be.

    Looking forward to having you as an active member of the community!
